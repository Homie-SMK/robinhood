Architecture Decision Records
#############################

*Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. --G. Santayana*

The documents contained in this directory should describe every meaningful and
reasoned decision that deeply impacts the project.

Definition
==========

An ADR is a record of why a certain decision was made and in which context. It
also generally includes the different options which were considered, and why
some of them were rejected.

Motivation
==========

ADRs help:

- onboard new contributors;
- ensure we do not start thinking from scratch everytime;
- identify decisions that have expired.

Format
======

The format of these documents is rather free at the moment... That is, until a
good format gets decided upon.

FAQ
===

Are these documents immutable once published?
---------------------------------------------

Definitely not! Decisions should not be set in stone! On the other hand, no part
of these documents should be overwritten or even deleted lightly.

ADRs or documentation?
----------------------

Why not both?

ADRs and documentation serve similar but ultimately different purposes. The
existence of one should not preclude the redaction of the other.
